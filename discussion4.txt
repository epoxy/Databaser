Motivations for any non-standad choices in your triggers.

In both triggers, if the course has limited available places we check this with 
help of two queries.  First we check if the course has limited places and store
this information as an INT (number 1) in the variable IsLimitedCourse. Then we do an if 
statement to see if isLimitedCourse has value 1 and count the available places. When we do
this we cant get any exception messages from Oracle that says "NO DATA FOUND".

In the trigger RegAtStudent we throw three exceptions if the student already is registered 
or waiting fo the course, if the student has already passed the corse and if the student 
has not passed the course's required courses.

Exceptions are not necessary in the trigger UnRegStudent. When a deletion is trying to be 
made the student and course will be looked up and if they do not exist nothing will happen 
and the trigger will never be trigged anyway which will never cause an exception.
